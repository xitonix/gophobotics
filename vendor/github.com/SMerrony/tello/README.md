# tello Go Package
This tello package provides an unofficial, easy-to-use, standalone API for the Ryze TelloÂ® drone.

## Disclaimer

Tello is a registered trademark of Ryze Tech.  The author of this package is in no way affiliated with Ryze, DJI, or Intel.  

The package has been developed by gathering together information from a variety of sources on the Internet (especially https://tellopilots.com) and by examining data packets sent to/from the Tello.  The package will probably be extended as more knowledge of the drone's protocol is obtained.

Use this package at your own risk.  The author(s) is/are in no way responsible for any damage caused either to or by the drone when using this software.

## Features

The following features have been implemented...
  * Stick-based flight control, ie. for joystick, game-, or flight-controller
  * Drone built-in flight commands, eg. Takeoff(), PalmLand()
  * Macro-level flight control, eg. Forward(), Up()
  * Autopilot flight control, eg. AutoFlyToHeight(), AutoFlyToXY()
  * Video stream support
  * Enriched flight-data (some log data is added)
  * Picture taking/saving support 
  * Multiple drone support - Untested

See [ImplementationChart.md](https://github.com/SMerrony/tello/blob/master/ImplementationChart.md) for full details of what functions are currently implemented.

Documentation should be available locally via godoc, or via [godoc.org](https://godoc.org/github.com/SMerrony/tello).

An example application using this package is available at [telloterm](https://github.com/SMerrony/telloterm).

Here is an example of just about the simplest use of the package...
```
package main
import (
  "log"
  "time"
  "github.com/SMerrony/tello"
)

func main() {
  	drone := new(tello.Tello)
  err := drone.ControlConnectDefault()
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("%v", err) 
  }

  drone.TakeOff()
  time.Sleep(10 * time.Second)
  drone.Land()
  drone.ControlDisconnect()
}
```

## Concepts
### Connection Types
The drone provides two types of connection: a 'control' connection which handles all commands
to and from the drone including flight, status and (still) pictures, and a 'video' connection which
provides an H.264 video stream from the forward-facing camera.  

You must establish a control connection to use the drone, but the video connection is optional and cannot be started unless a control connection is running.

### Funcs vs. Channels
Certain functionality is made available in two forms: single-shot function calls and streaming (channel) data flows.
Eg. GetFlightData() vs. StreamFlightData(), and UpdateSticks() vs. StartStickListener().  

Use whichever paradigm you prefer, but be aware that the channel-based calls should return immediately (the channels are buffered) whereas the function-based options could conceivably cause your application to pause very briefly if the Tello is very busy; in practice, the author has not found this to be an issue.
